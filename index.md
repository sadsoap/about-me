 Welcome! My name is Sophia Davis, and I am studying computer Science at UCSD. I aim to hone my skills as much as possible before heading into a position in the industry after school, and I am excited to see what challenges may come in my remaining years as a student, and beyond. 

  In the interest of sharing more personal things about myself, I have curated a list of some ["favorites" below](). Before that, however, here are some of my general priorities I use to guide myself in life. 

 ### Some Priorities ###
 1. Family
 2. Scholastic/Career dedications
 3. Self-care
 4. Friendships/Social Connection

### "Favorite" List ###

Adventure Zone*

* My favorite programming language is `Java`. This is how you'd print "Hello, world" to screen: `System.out.print("Hello, world");`
